# Mask CycleGAN

The Mask CycleGAN is an improvment to the original CycleGAN, indeed it deals with an Image-To-Image Translation between two domains.
It use a different architecture and a masking scheme to solve two main problems of CycleGAN, that are the unimodality in image translation and the lack of interpretability of latent variables.

## Installation

To execute the Main Notebook you have to open it on Google Colab and execute it: indeed the git clone command is already inserted in the code, and you have not to perform it.
